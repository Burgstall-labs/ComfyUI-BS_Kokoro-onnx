As long as the repo is not registered on ComfyUI-Manager, it is best to install in the terminal:
# cd custom_nodes
# git clone https://github.com/Burgstall-labs/ComfyUI-BS_Kokoro-onnx
# cd ComfyUI-BS_Kokoro-onnx
# pip install -r requirements.txt

Then download the needed files from:
# https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files/kokoro-v0_19.onnx
# https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files/voices.json

And place them in the /custom_nodes/ComfyUI-BS-Kokoro-onnx/ folder

Example workflow available in the Example -folder.

I think the license is inherited as follows:

    kokoro-onnx: MIT
    kokoro model: Apache 2.0

This is my first repo, be gentle.
